Elbow method for clustering -> how to define the optimal number of clusters?
GPT advantages for my thesis?
How llm embeddings work?
Transformers

MENTION that noise in clustring could be because of the emails which don t follow each other, missing emails in the dataframe, but it was a shame to delete them

some plots info about the dataset, time maybe in the beginning, aggle inspired

Read more about the models!! all steps of llms
read more about different types of embeddings

in diplom about the embedding
story about choosing the embedding -> try it, different groups subject, then performing clustering to try to find clusters: hi examples, booking airbnb, maybe sth else
time wrap on them

add example of how the chain looks llike, that i have to remove the repeating part

all problems, duo=plicates, with different senders, emails

recall all the satges about the dataframe creation, checking

emails subjects distribution
longest chain
emails length distribution


email lenghth dist before and after cleaning. plots, example of nested emails
detect most similar emails
