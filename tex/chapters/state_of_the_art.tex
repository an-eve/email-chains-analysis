\chapter{State of the Art}
\label{chp:state_of_the_art}

 In this section, we delve into the concepts and areas of interest within process extraction and email mining. We discuss ongoing trends, the technologies currently in use, and highlight some recent papers and the challenges faced in these fields. Additionally, we explore the works related to the Enron email dataset and examine email mining from a data mining perspective, which is particularly relevant to our project. This comprehensive overview aims to provide a deeper understanding of the current landscape.
